outline

	 
	- initially data from MC has been read and all the available "mclinks" have been kept in "tab_stock_mclink"
	- Data from BSE and NSE bhavcopies are read and the ISIN has been obtained for every trading stock.
	- the ISINs that have been obtained from bhavcopies are stored in "tab_stock_info"
	- So initially, "tab_stock_info" tables "mclink" fiels is blank and the table contains only ISINs
	- Data from "tab_stock_info" has been read and a MAP has been formed
	- Map<isin, StockInfoBean>
	- After obtaining the ISINs from the bhavcopies, the first 800 mclinks are read from "tab_stock_mclink" and from those mclinks, data from MC has been obtained(faceValue, company name, sector name and market cap)
	- This data has been updated to "tab_stock_info"
	- after this read SET of mclinks are deleted from "tab_stock_mclink" and the new SET has been obtained and this process continues for the remaining mclinks.
	- some records in "tab_stock_info" may have blank mclinks (152) and some of them are "DVR"s and the trading in these stocks may be avoided(Since the trading volume is very low in DVRs)
